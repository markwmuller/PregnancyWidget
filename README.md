# Title

Pregnancy countdown 

#  Description (Maximum 4,000 Characters)

Are you excited about an incoming baby? Me too! 

This open source widget gives you some quick relevant info at a glance. I made it when I found out my wife was pregnant, and it was a way to turn my panic into semi-productivity. 

Enter the due date, and the widget calculates some basic predicted approximate statistics (progress, the baby's approximate weight and approximate length). 

This app is not intended to be used for the purposes of medical treatment and is intended for educational purposes only. This widget should be treated as a bit of fun by an excited dad/mom-to-be; for any serious matters please refer to your healthcare professionals (not some random engineer). 

*Privacy notice: No information ever leaves your device. There is nothing tracking you here.* 

The baby length & mass are estimated with data taken from here -- https://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy/your-body/growth-chart-fetal-length-and-weight-week-by-week_1290794
